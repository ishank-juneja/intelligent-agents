PA1: Algorithms for regret minimization in Multi Armed Bandits
Multi Armed bandits are a sequential decision making framework where a choice has to be made between several options, which in the resource allocation world could be communication channels for instance. Once a choice is made, the outcome could either be a success or failure. Initially we start with no knowledge and improve our decision making over time.

The algorithms implemented for regret minimization were
- Round Robin Sampling
- epsilon greedy
- UCB
- KL UCB
- Thompson Sampling

PA2: MDP Planning using,
- Linear Programming
- Howard's Policy Iteration

PA3: Value function Prediction for a policy
- Using Model based policy evaluation

PA4: Model free control in RL
- Using SARSA
